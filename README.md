# Magicfree JSON
[![Build Status](https://github.com/ksclarke/magicfree-json/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ksclarke/magicfree-json/actions/workflows/build.yml)

A simple JSON library that doesn't attempt to do anything fancy (like POJO mapping), but insteads provides an event-based interface (and generic object model) that can 
be used to work with JSON documents. It's a fork of the [minimal-json](https://github.com/ralfstx/minimal-json) project, which is no longer maintained.

It's just an experiment at this point, so I wouldn't really expect others to be all that interested in it, but here it is.

## License(s)

Magicfree JSON is released under the [MPL v2](LICENSE.txt), but incorporates a lot of code from the [minimal-json](https://github.com/ralfstx/minimal-json) project, 
which was released under the MIT License. This additional license, which would also still apply, can be viewed in the [third party licenses](src/licenses/) directory.
