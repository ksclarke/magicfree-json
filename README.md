A simple JSON library that doesn't attempt to do anything fancy (like POJO mapping), but insteads provides an
event-based interface (and generic object model) that can be used to work with JSON documents. It's a fork of the very
nice [minimal-json](https://github.com/ralfstx/minimal-json) project, which is no longer active or maintained.

MF-JSON just an experiment at this point, so I wouldn't really expect others to be interested in it, but here it is.

## License(s)

MagicFree JSON is released under the [MPL v2](LICENSE.txt), but incorporates _a lot_ of code from the no longer active
[minimal-json](https://github.com/ralfstx/minimal-json) project, which was released under the MIT License. This
additional license, which would also still apply, can be viewed in the [third party licenses](src/licenses/) directory.
